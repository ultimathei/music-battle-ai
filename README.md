This is the code repository for my Computer Science, Bsc. final year project at Queen Mary University of London.

In order to be able to use this application you need to use Google Chrome and have a USB/MIDI keyboard controller plugged in

The project backend is not built, I am using a mock Database of users you can see the mock details for login in `src/scripts/services/users_DB.js`

# installation
This project was built using node, npm and webpack bundler.
In order to run the application you need to have node and npm installed.

Also you need to create a file called `.babelrc` in the root folder and save this object in it:
`{"presets": [ "es2015", "stage-0" ]}`

once that's done run : `npm install` from root folder
then run `npm run dev` from root folder
and your app should open in localhost.
